# Motivation

Came across a stackoverflow post asking for assistance in embedding python code
in a vim ultisnip snippet. 
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78636197/how-do-i-integrate-python-code-in-ultisnips)

The function is 

```python
def make_chords(num_reps):
    text = ""
    for i in range(num_reps):
        text += "< > "
    return text
```
